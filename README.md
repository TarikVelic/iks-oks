"Xs and Os" is a classic two-player social game, also known as "tic-tac-toe." The objective is to be the first to place three identical symbols in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (usually "X" or "O") on empty squares until one player wins or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw. It's a simple yet entertaining game that helps develop logical thinking and strategic skills. It can be played on paper, a wooden or plastic board, or various digital platforms, making it a popular choice for all ages with minimal equipment required."
